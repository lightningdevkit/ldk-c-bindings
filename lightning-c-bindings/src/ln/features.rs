//! Feature flag definitions for the Lightning protocol according to [BOLT #9].
//!
//! Lightning nodes advertise a supported set of operation through feature flags. Features are
//! applicable for a specific context as indicated in some [messages]. [`Features`] encapsulates
//! behavior for specifying and checking feature flags for a particular context. Each feature is
//! defined internally by a trait specifying the corresponding flags (i.e., even and odd bits). A
//! [`Context`] is used to parameterize [`Features`] and defines which features it can support.
//!
//! Whether a feature is considered \"known\" or \"unknown\" is relative to the implementation, whereas
//! the term \"supports\" is used in reference to a particular set of [`Features`]. That is, a node
//! supports a feature if it advertises the feature (as either required or optional) to its peers.
//! And the implementation can interpret a feature if the feature is known to it.
//!
